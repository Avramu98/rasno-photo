# RasnoPH

Welcome! This personal project offers a seamless experience for both photographers and users alike.

The platform is equipped with a user-friendly Content Management System (CMS) that allows photographers to easily upload, edit, and delete their content.

For users, the website features a stunning landing page that includes a featured portfolio section, an "About" page that provides more information about the photographer and their work. A "Contact" page that allows users to get in touch with the photographer directly. A "Services" page where the photographer can showcase the services that he offers to the clients. In addition, the portfolio page is designed to showcase the photographer's best work, so that users can easily browse and find the photos that speak to them. 

The website can be visited here <a href="https://www.rasno-photo.ro" target="_blank">Rasno Photography</a>
